# 📚 Academic Tracker (Stellar + Rust + React)

A decentralized web application built to help students manage academic tests, events, and club activities securely on the **Stellar blockchain**.  
The project combines a **Rust backend**, a **React frontend**, and **smart contracts** to create a tamper-proof record of academic data.

## 🧾 Project Description

Academic Tracker is a simple yet powerful platform that keeps your academic calendar organized.  
It lets users create, view, and manage academic events like exams, workshops, and cultural activities.  
Every event is recorded through a **Stellar smart contract**, ensuring data is verifiable and trustworthy.

**Tech Stack:**
- 🦀 Backend: Rust (Axum)
- ⚛️ Frontend: React + TailwindCSS
- 🌐 Blockchain: Stellar Smart Contracts
- 🗄️ Database: Planned (JSON or SQLite for local storage)

## 🎯 Project Vision

To make academic tracking transparent, organized, and decentralized.  
The goal is to eliminate the confusion around multiple deadlines and event overlaps by giving students one clean, secure platform to track everything — backed by blockchain authenticity.

**Core Vision Points:**
- Help students manage their academic life efficiently.  
- Use blockchain for accountability and data integrity.  
- Create a foundation that can scale to institutional use later.
